# awesome-low-level-programming-languages

A curated list of low level programming languages primarily aimed and OS and game
programming.

**They are all shit.** [Operating systems should not exist](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html), and [gameshit focus on performance is a hazard to society.](https://plover.com/~mjd/misc/hbaker-archive/letters/CACM-DubiousAchievement.html) Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

This list is perfect, so don't bother sending pull-requests.

> I see a lot of people in the Lisp regions being strangely afraid of the CLOS [Common Lisp Object System] performance boogeyman. So here's some observations: [Kandria](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria) runs on my 10 year old Intel machine at a steady 120FPS. During every frame, it dispatches multiple events to over 1000 objects, all through a single generic function. This generic function has over 200 methods attached, and most of those methods are specialising on multiple arguments.

> It is absolutely, demonstrably fine.
